Online Complaint Submission System for Municipalities in Palestine
Introduction
This project is an online platform designed to enable citizens to submit and track complaints to their local municipalities in Palestine, while providing municipal administrators with tools to manage these complaints efficiently. The system aims to modernize complaint handling, increase transparency, and improve public service delivery through a secure and user-friendly digital interface.
Project Status
The project is currently in the planning phase. The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document has been completed and uploaded to the repository, outlining the system's requirements and planned development stages. Development has not yet started.
Server Requirements
To run the service on a server, the following hardware and software components are required:
Hardware Requirements

Server: A dedicated or virtual server with a multi-core CPU, at least 16GB RAM, and an SSD with 100GB or more storage to handle user traffic and data.
Backup Server or Cloud Storage: For regular backups of user data, complaints, and logs (e.g., AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage).
Network Infrastructure: Reliable connectivity with firewalls, routers, and load balancers for security and performance.

Software Requirements

Web Server Software: Apache or Nginx to host the website and manage HTTP requests.
Database Management System: MySQL for storing user profiles, complaints, and administrative data.
Security Tools: HTTPS/SSL for encrypted data transmission, Web Application Firewall (WAF) for protection, and role-based access control (RBAC) for permissions.

Programming Languages
The system will be built using the following technologies:

Back-end: PHP for server-side logic and database interactions.
Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for a responsive user interface, with potential use of frameworks like React or Vue.js.
Database: MySQL for structured data storage.

Additional Information

The SRS document, available in the repository, provides a detailed reference for the system's functional and non-functional requirements.
Development will follow the Spiral Model, with iterative cycles to manage risks and refine the system.
Once development begins, this README will be updated with setup instructions and contribution guidelines.
