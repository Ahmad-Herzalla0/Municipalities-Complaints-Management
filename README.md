# Municipal Complaints Management System

**Status:** Under Development

## Project Overview
The Municipal Complaints Management System (MCMS) is an electronic platform designed to streamline the reporting, tracking, and resolution of municipal service issues. Citizens can submit complaints about public infrastructure, sanitation, lighting, water supply, and other municipal services. Municipal staff can review, assign, and resolve complaints efficiently, with real-time status updates and analytics.

## Key Features
- **Citizen Portal**: 
  - User registration and authentication (email/SMS verification).
  - Complaint submission with location (GPS or address), description, and photo attachments.
  - Real-time tracking: view complaint status (Submitted, In Progress, Resolved).
  - Feedback and rating after resolution.

- **Admin Dashboard**: 
  - Complaint assignment to departments or field agents.
  - Status updates and notifications (email/SMS) to citizens.
  - Performance metrics: average resolution time, open vs. closed complaints, departmental workload.
  - Role-based access control for administrators, supervisors, and technicians.

- **Analytics & Reporting**: 
  - Generate periodic reports (daily, weekly, monthly).
  - Export data to CSV/PDF.
  - Geographical heatmaps for complaint density.

## Viewing the SRS Document
1. Navigate to the `SRS/` folder.
2. Open `Project Reports.docx` in Microsoft Word or convert to PDF for easier reading.

## Required Programming Languages
- **PHP**: used for server-side scripting and business logic implementation.
- **HTML5**: to structure the web interface and complaint submission forms.
- **CSS3**: for styling and ensuring a responsive user interface.
- **JavaScript**: for client-side interactivity and dynamic content handling.
- **JavaScript Frameworks (e.g., React or Vue.js)**: to build robust and maintainable front-end components.

## Development Roadmap (Future Steps)
1. Fork the repository and clone to your local machine.
2. Set up environment variables (`.env`) for database and mail service.
3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd src/backend
   composer install
````

4. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
5. Initialize the database and run migrations:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```
6. Start development servers:

   ```bash
   # Backend
   php artisan serve

   # Frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Roadmap

1. **Repository Initialization**: configure Git branches, CI/CD pipelines.
2. **SRS Conversion**: migrate requirements from Word to Markdown in `docs/`.
3. **Environment Setup**: Docker Compose for local services (PHP, MySQL, Redis).
4. **Authentication Module**: implement user sign-up, login, password reset.
5. **Complaint Workflow**: CRUD operations for complaints, status transitions.
6. **Notification Service**: integrate Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email.
7. **Dashboard & Analytics**: build admin interface and reporting tools.
8. **Testing & QA**: write unit and integration tests, end-to-end tests.
9. **Deployment**: prepare production configuration (AWS/GCP).
